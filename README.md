<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Real-time Updates: The application uses Socket.io to provide real-time updates. When a task is created, updated, or deleted, all connected users will receive these updates instantly. This ensures that all users have the most up-to-date information at all times
- Task Management: Users can create, update, and delete tasks. These tasks are stored in MongoDB and can be accessed by all logged-in users
- User Authorization: The application uses JWT for user authorization. When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and stored in the local storage. This token is then included in the Authorization header for each request to the server
- Shared Tasks: Tasks are shared between logged-in users. This means that any changes made to a task by one user will be immediately visible to all other users
- Responsive Design: The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable, responsive design
